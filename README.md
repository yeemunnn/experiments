Experiments with machine learning.

Bad Habits is an experiment on how we can create our own interventions using machine learning to manage our bad habits. When you're mindlessly carrying out habitual actions in front of the laptop, GIFs will appear to tell you to stop when you're doing something bad and encourage you when you're doing something healthy.
This project uses Processing and ml4a.
